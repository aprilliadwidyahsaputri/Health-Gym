        content: `HIIT (High Intensity Interval Training) adalah jenis olahraga intensitas tinggi yang dilakukan dalam durasi 10 hingga 30 menit. Manfaatnya dapat menunjang kesehatan jantung, pembuluh darah dan membentuk massa otot. Mengutip Setforset, HIIT dilakukan lebih singkat daripada sesi kardio aerobik. Meski begitu, kamu bisa membakar lebih banyak kalori. Menurut Healthline, sebuah studi membandingkan kalori yang terbakar selama 30 menit dari masing-masing latihan HIIT. Hasilnya, HIIT membakar 25-30% lebih banyak kalori dibandingkan olahraga lainnya. Semakin banyak kalori yang dibakar, semakin besar kemungkinan kamu mengalami defisit kalori. Hal ini akan menyebabkan cadangan lemak dalam tubuh meleleh dalam waktu singkat. HIIT akan langsung meningkatkan VO2max, yaitu berapa banyak oksigen yang bisa dikonsumsi tubuh selama berolahraga.Hal ini dapat membuat jantung memompa lebih banyak darah dan oksigen melalui sistem peredaran darah.Selain memberikan kemampuan kepada otot untuk menghasilkan lebih banyak tenaga dari oksigen itu, HIIT juga akan menurunkan tekanan darah dan risiko penyakit jantung. Mengutip Setforset, lari juga merupakan gerakan HIIT cardio yang bisa membakar lemak. Sebagai titik awal, kamu bisa berjalan cepat selama 20 detik. Kemudian berjalan atau jogging selama 40 detik sampai 15 menit. `,
